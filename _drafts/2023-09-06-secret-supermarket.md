# Secret Supermarket

Historically, the games I've released spans a pretty wide range; from
experimental narrative "experiences" to hard-core 2-player
brawlers. To make my output as a game developer a bit more organized
and easier to understand, I've decided to create a 'label' for some of
the new games I'm planning to release. This label is for work that
straddles the line between physical and digital games. Those will be
computer games that tries to bring a lot of what I find appealing with
board games into the digital realm. In short, that will mean quite
deep and strategic games with lots of player interaction. My goal is
to build a community around this label, and to develop its games in an
open way with a lot of feedback from that community.

The name of the label is _*Secret Supermarket*_.

For other kinds of projects, e.g. narrative games or art pieces, I
will not use any label. Regarding my latest project [Ord](), it is
still work in progress. Given the amount of time it would take to
finish, I'll not focus on it for now.
