I just turned 38, which (as I'm sure you'd agree) is a pretty
unremarkable age. In between taking care of ones kids and working on new
games, it's the kind of thing that easily gets a bit
neglected. But there is *one* thing I have been thinking about in
anticipation of this birthday – a kind of bet with myself that I
came up with a couple of years ago...

The thing is, I've been playing
[Go](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) quite seriously since
I was 18, or so. As a kid I used to read any book I could find about
board games, so I actually did learn the game a few years earlier, but
it wasn't until I started [university](https://www.his.se/dataspel)
that I met other people who played. Some of them were even very good!
That inspired me to become a lot more serious with the game. I started
playing online on Go-servers, read books about strategy, and so on.

For those unware, anyone even a little serious about Go also keeps
track of their
[rank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings) through a
system mirroring the ones used in various martial arts. You start at
30 kyu, and work your way downwards to 1. The rank is very useful,
because it also tells you what advantage (or 'handicap') the
weaker player should get to make the game even. For example, between
two players of rank 10 kyu and 12 kyu there's a difference of two, so
the weaker player should start with two stones on the board –
effectively two free moves. This is called being "two stones
stronger".

When you play online, the server keeps track of your rank and modifies
it based on wins and losses. This works very much like
[Elo](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo-rating) on Chess servers and
in other competitive games. When you play casually against others, you
often state the rank you believe that you are, to find a suitable
opponent at the club, or just to get a feel for how deep someones
understanding of the game is.

So what happens when you reach 1 kyu, you might ask? That's when you
switch ranking scale to something called 'dan' and start going up
instead. So someone that is one stone stronger than 1 kyu is called a
1 dan, then 2 dan, and so on. This is also called *Shodan*, which
translates to something like "first rank". It's an interesting name,
because it sounds a lot like where you would start as a beginner. That
mirrors the thinking in for example Karate, where one would for
example say something like "Shodan is the true beginning of Karate".

Which is what this is all about. The thing is that I haven't reached
Shodan yet. I've played a game for 20+ years and I'm still not even
good enough to be classified as a beginner! That is not to say you
can't enjoy the game at the kyu level, it's absolutely possible.
I've had so much fun with it. But there is this nagging feeling that
to really appreciate its beauty, ideally I should at least reach 1 dan.
