Dear friends,

It is with great pleasure that I'm announcing my
return to full-time indie game development.

For the last three years I've been working for a startup called
[coherence](https://coherence.io), creating a toolkit for multiplayer
games. It has been a lot of fun &mdash; I've learned a lot about
networking and how to make online games from some amazing people. But
while making tools for others is certainly very enjoyable, my true
passion is to work on my own designs. So back to being indie it is,
wish me luck!

Cheers,
Erik
