Today I'm happy to announce my upcoming game, *Manahex*. It's a
digital card game designed, programmed, scored and painted by yours
truly. If all goes well, it will be released this spring.

You can read more about the gameplay on the [Steam
page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2774650/Manahex/). Wishlisting
is much appreciated! <3

Here's a trailer:
