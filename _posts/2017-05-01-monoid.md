An [Ikaruga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga)-inspired space shooter made together with [Ossian Bor√©n](http://ossianboren.com) during the Banana Jam 2017. He programmed and designed most of the game, I just made the enemies (art + movement).

This game (just like [Fluctus](https://www.eriksvedang.com/fluctus) from the year before) was made using [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), Ossian's weapon of choice when it comes to game making. The final game was displayed in an arcade cabinet made out of cardboard banana boxes. Thanks a lot to [Erik Einebrant](https://twitter.com/z3zard) for helping us out with that!
