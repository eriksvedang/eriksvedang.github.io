This game was co-designed with [Ossian Bor√©n](http://ossianboren.com). We wanted to make a collectible card game (think Magic the Gathering) but where the players themselves were allowed to design the cards. We developed the rules at the [No More Sweden](/no-more-sweden) game jam 2015 and during later playtests in Gothenburg. We also made a website (link above) with a form for entering cards into a shared database.
