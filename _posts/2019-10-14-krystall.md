This was a piece of commisioned work for the University Museum of Bergen (Norway), in collaboration with exhibition designer [Adam Bartley](https://bartleyadam.myportfolio.com/). The goal was to create an interactive installation where the museum visitors could experiment with the basic rules of crystal growth in a simplified and playful way.

The end result is a kind of microscope simulator with a special built hardware interface. Using large control knobs you can change two different parameters &mdash; concentration and temperature, which happen to be the two most important factors for crystals forming (or dissolving). The simulation is in 2D to make it easier to understand.

The piece is part of a larger exhibition about crystals and can be found in the natural history building of the University Museum of Bergen.
