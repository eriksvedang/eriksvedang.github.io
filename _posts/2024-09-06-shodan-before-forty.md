I just turned 38, which if we're being honest is a pretty boring
birthday. In between taking care of ones kids and working on new
games, it's the kind of thing that easily gets a bit
neglected. But there has been *one* thing that I have been thinking about in
anticipation of this birthday – a kind of bet with myself that I
came up with a couple of years ago...

The thing is, I've been playing this game, [Go](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), quite seriously since
I was 18, or so. As a kid I used to read any book I could find about
board games, so I actually did learn the game a few years earlier, but
it wasn't until I started [university](https://www.his.se/dataspel)
that I met other people who played. Some of them were even very good!
That inspired me to become a lot more serious with the game. I started
playing online on Go-servers, read books about strategy, study old
games, and so on.

For those unware, anyone who is even just a little serious about Go also keeps
track of their
[rank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings) through a
system similar to the ones used in various martial arts. You start at
30 kyu, and work your way downwards to 1. Knowing your rank is very useful,
because it also tells you what advantage (or 'handicap') the
weaker player should get to make the game even. For example, between
two players of rank 10 kyu and 14 kyu there's a difference of four, so
the weaker player should start with four stones on the board –
effectively four free moves. This is called being "four stones
stronger".

When you play online, the server keeps track of your rank and modifies
it based on wins and losses. This works very much like
[Elo](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo-rating) on Chess servers and
in other competitive games. When you play casually against others, you
often state the rank you believe that you have – to find a suitable
opponent at the club, or just to get a feel for how
deep someones understanding of the game is.

So the rank starts at 30 and goes downwards... but what happens when
you reach 1 kyu, you might ask? That's when the ranking scale switches
to something called 'dan' and start counting up instead. So someone
that is one stone stronger than 1 kyu is 1 dan, then 2 dan, 3 dan, and
so on all the way up to 9 dan. Having the rank 1 dan is also called
*Shodan*, which translates to something like "first rank". It's a very
interesting name, because it sounds a lot like where you would
actually start as a beginner. That mirrors the thinking in for example
Karate, where one could for example say something like "Shodan is the
true beginning of Karate". In other words, it isn't until you've
reached dan level that you understand anything about the true spirit
of the game.

Now, I'm not entirely sure about this sentiment. A good game is
ideally fun even before you've sunk thousands of hours into it, and Go
is a very good game indeed.

Which is what this is all about. The thing is that I haven't reached
Shodan yet. I've played a game for 20+ years and I'm still not even
good enough to be classified as a "beginner"!
