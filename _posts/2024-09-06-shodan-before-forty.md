*The woodcut 'Raikō shitennō to
tsuchigumo' by Utagawa Kuninaga.*

Earlier this week I turned 38. Unsurprisingly, it was not the most
exciting birthday. And in many ways it passed by in a quite
unremarkable fashion – taking the kids to school, working on my
games. Still, this birthday had an additional meaning to me, something
that gave it a certain significance in my mind:

*"Only two years left."*

No, this has nothing to do with my expected lifespan (I hope). Rather,
what I couldn't get out of my mind was this bet I made with myself a
couple of years ago...

But let's start at the beginning. *Go* is a utterly fascinating game,
for many reasons (check out its [wikipedia
page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) if you don't know
much about it). Personally, I learned about it from a book when I was a
teenager, but it wasn't until I started
university that I met others who
played. Severeal of those people were quite good and they inspired me
to become a lot more serious with the game. I started playing online,
read strategy books, study old masters, and so on.

For those unware, people who play Go usually keep track of their
[rank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings) using a
system similar to the ones used in various martial arts. You start at
30 *kyu*, and work your way downwards to 1 kyu. Knowing your rank is
very useful, because it also tells you what advantage (or 'handicap')
the weaker player should get to make for an even game. For example,
between two players of rank 10 kyu and 14 kyu there's a difference of
four, so the weaker player should start with four stones on the board
– effectively four free moves. This is called being "four stones
stronger". When you play online, the server keeps track of your rank
and modifies it based on wins and losses. This works very much like
[Elo](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo-rating) on Chess servers and
in other competitive games. When you play casually against others, you
often state the rank you believe that you have – to find a suitable
opponent at a club, or just to get a feel for how deep someone's
understanding of the game is.

So the rank starts at 30 kyu and goes downwards. But what happens when
you reach 1 kyu, you might ask? At that point the rank switches to the
*dan* scale and start counting upwards instead. So someone that is one
stone stronger than 1 kyu is 1 dan, then 2 dan, 3 dan, and so on all
the way up to 9 dan. Having the rank 1 dan is also called *shodan*,
which translates to something like "first rank". This is quite an
interesting name, because without any context, it kind of sounds like
the rank you'd start with, as a beginner. In other words, when you
reach dan level you kind of start over. This makes sense to me –
without a beginners mindset it's very hard to improve at anything. You
can't learn if you believe that you're "done".

Now, I'm not entirely sure about how important it is to reach the dan
level. A good game is ideally fun even when you're not *that*
experienced, and Go is a very good game indeed. A lot of its beauty is
there for you to see after playing just a few times. With a bit of
guidance professional games can be thoroughly enjoyed, even though
most of their depth lies hidden to amateurs. Still, there's a common
conception among players that you want to become 1 dan at some
point. In a game as deep as Go, winning often feels a bit undeserved,
since none of the players really knew what was going on. Focusing on
self-improvement and your own progress is more productive than
sherishing singular victories.

How long does it take to reach shodan? That is a hard question to
answer – some people achieve it within a year after they start
playing. Others, like me, never quite get there. A few years ago this
started to bother me properly. I realized that I have played a game
(that I love) for about two decades, and I was still a "n00b"..!

I decided to give myself a deadline; I wanted to reach shodan before I
turned 40. This felt like a realistic goal. At the time I was maybe 5
kyu and felt that I was improving, although slowly. I knew that the
key to improving is to play a lot of games. Unfortunately, a single
game of Go can be quite long and my spare time is severely limited. To
get more plays in I started to play quick games online. This was a
terrible idea – I ran out of thinking time a lot and the stress made
me play really badly. I started losing against people with much lower
ranks, which made my own rank plummet. It was not a great feeling.

*Relax, it's just a game.*

I wanted to write this article to motivate myself. In two years I will
read it again and see if I reached my goal. It's kind of exciting. My
predicition is that I will be unsatisfied, no matter the outcome. If I
do manage to reach shodan, I'll most likely want to become 2 dan. And
if not, well then I failed. Perhaps that will make me sad, but I will
be fine. I'll keep trying to teach my kids.

And maybe (just maybe) I can find happiness in playing this
game that I love, only for the fun of it.
