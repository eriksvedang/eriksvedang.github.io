*Manahex* is a digital card & board game for 2 to 4 players. It is
played on a map of hexes, which your mage can control to gain
mana. The mana is used to pay for your cards (spells, creatures,
buildings, etc). With the cards you try to defeat the other players
and be the last mage standing. The game contains over 100 different
cards with handmade art, and they are all unlocked from the start to
facilitate creative deck building for all players.

This is the first of my games released under the [Secret&nbsp;Supermarket](https://www.secretsupermarket.com) label.
