*The woodcut 'Raik≈ç shitenn≈ç to
tsuchigumo' by Utagawa Kuninaga.*

Earlier this week I turned 38. It's not a very exciting age, I know. But
this birthday had an additional meaning to me. Something secret that gave
it a certain significance in my mind:

*"Only two years left."*

No, this has nothing to do with my expected lifespan (I hope). Rather,
what I couldn't stop thinking about was a bet I made with myself a
couple of years ago. But let's start at the beginning.

*Go* is a completely fascinating game (check out its [wikipedia
page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) if you don't know
much about it). I learned about it from a book when I was a teenager,
but it wasn't until I started university that I met others who
played. They inspired me to become a proper student of the game.

I started playing online,
read strategy books, studied old masters, and so on.

For those unware, Go players usually keep track of their skill using a
[ranking system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings)
similar to the ones in martial arts, e.g. Karate. As a beginner, you
start at 30 *kyu* and work your way downwards to 1 kyu. Knowing your
rank is very useful, because it also tells you what advantage the
weaker player should get to make for an even game. For example,
between two players of rank 10 kyu and 14 kyu there's a difference of
four, so the weaker player should start with four stones on the board
‚Äì effectively four free moves. This is called being "four stones
stronger". When you play online, the server keeps track of your rank
and modifies it based on wins and losses. This works very much like
[Elo](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo-rating) on Chess servers and
in other competitive games. When you play casually against others, you
often state the rank you believe that you have ‚Äì to find a suitable
opponent at a club, or just to get a feel for how deep someone's
understanding of the game is.

So the rank starts at 30 kyu and goes downwards. But what happens when
you reach 1 kyu, you might ask? At that point the rank switches to the
*dan* scale and start counting upwards instead! So someone that is one
stone stronger than 1 kyu is 1 dan, then 2 dan, 3 dan, and so on, all
the way up to 9 dan. The rank of 1 dan is also called *shodan*, which
translates to something like "first rank". This is quite an
interesting name, because without any context it sounds a lot like the
rank you'd start with as a beginner. In other words, when you reach
dan level you kind of start over. For a game so deeply steeped in
Eastern philosophy, this shouldn't sound surprising ‚Äì without a
[beginners mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) it's very
hard to improve at anything. You can't learn if you believe that
you're already an expert.

Now, it's debatable how important it is to reach the dan level. A good
game is ideally fun even when you're not *that* experienced, and Go is
a very good game indeed. Some of its beauty is there for you to see
after playing just a few times. With a bit of guidance professional
games can be thoroughly enjoyed, even though most of their depth lies
hidden to amateurs. Still, there's a shared sense among players that
you want to become 1 dan at some point. In a game as deep as Go,
winning often feels a bit undeserved. None of the players *really*
knew what was going on, after all! Focusing on self-improvement and
your own progress is more productive than sherishing singular
victories. Ultimately, this makes you care about your rank even more.

How long does it take to reach shodan? That is a hard question to
answer ‚Äì some people achieve it within a year after they start
playing. Others, like me, never quite get there. A few years ago this
started to bother me more and more. I realized that I have played a game
(that I love) for about two decades, and I was still a "n00b"..! If I
didn't give it my best shot soon, I might never achieve even this
first level of mastery. üò±

I decided to give myself a deadline; I wanted to reach shodan before I
turned 40. This felt like a realistic goal. At the time I was maybe 5
kyu and felt that I was improving, although slowly. I knew that the
key to getting better is to play a lot of games. Unfortunately, a
regular game of Go can be quite long (an hour or more) and my spare
time is severely limited. To get more plays in I started to play short
"blitz" games online. This was a terrible idea ‚Äì I ran out of thinking
time a lot and the stress made me play really badly. I started losing
against people with much lower ranks, which made my own rank
plummet. It was ugly.

*Relax, it's just a game.*

After a shorter break (and some soul-searching) I managed to find my
footing once more. Though I lost a lot in a short time, I can feel
that I'm actually stronger than I've ever been. A rank is just a
number.  I have started playing online again, but with slower
games. My opponents are really easy now that I get matched against
people with such a low rank. I practice as often as I can, but try to
not stress about it.

I wrote this article to motivate myself, to be a bit more
accountable. In two years I will read it again and see if I reached my
goal. It's kind of exciting. My predicition is that I will be
unsatisfied, no matter the outcome. If I do manage to reach shodan,
I'll most likely want to achieve the next rank, and so on. And if not,
well, then I failed. Perhaps that will make me sad for a while, but I
will be fine. I'll keep trying to teach my kids.

And maybe (just maybe) I can find happiness in playing this
game that I love, only for the fun of it.
