I was born in Uppsala (Sweden) but grew up on the countryside in the
tiny village Haberga. There I roamed the forest and learned how to
play the clarinet, among other things.

When I was 12 years old our family moved to the west coast of
Sweden. Me and my three younger siblings spent a lot of time making
movies. I also practiced magic but decided to not become a wizard
until my beard was gray.

In 2005 I moved to Sk√∂vde to study game design at the university. My
final thesis was the game [Blueberry Garden](/blueberry-garden) which
through its successes allowed me to become a full time independent
game developer.

Soon after that I was lucky enough to spend five years working with
awesome friends on [a very ambitious project](/else-heart-break).

I lived in Gothenburg for 10 years, but since the summer of 2019 I'm
based in Halmstad with my partner [Marie](http://mariesundberg.com)
and our two kids.
