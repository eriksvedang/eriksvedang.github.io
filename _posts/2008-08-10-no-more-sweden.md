No More Sweden was a gathering of independent game developers from the
whole world meeting up somewhere in Sweden, making games and partying
for a weekend. At it's peak, we had around 100 visitors.

The event was been run by me and Martin Jonasson
([@grapefrukt](https://twitter.com/grapefrukt)) from 2008
to 2018. Read more about it at
