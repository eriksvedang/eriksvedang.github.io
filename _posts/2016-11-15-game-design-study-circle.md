My big interest in board games and their history inspired me to run a study circle on the topic.

Eight times during the autumn of 2016 a group of people gathered at Lindholmen (Gothenburg) to play various board and card games from around the world, both new and old.

Hopefully I will have time to do a second run at some point. [Get in touch](/contact) if you're interested in participating!
