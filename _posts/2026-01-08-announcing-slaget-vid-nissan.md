I'm very happy to announce that I, together with miniature landscape
builder [Erik Fälth](https://www.youtube.com/@eriksminiworlds/), and
comic book artist & illustrator [Olof
Hjalmar](https://olofhjalmar.webflow.io/), have received funding from the [Region of
Halland](https://www.regionhalland.se/kultur) to
develop a tabletop miniatures game about ["Slaget vid Nissan"](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaget_vid_Nissan) / ["The Battle of
Niså"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nis%C3%A5) &mdash; one
of the largest naval viking battles ever to occur. (And it happened
just close to where we live.)

We are very thankful for the support of this project!

Now, our plan is to create a **huge** one-of-a-kind diorama game
board, filled with viking ships and their bloodthirsty crew. The game
itself will be equal measures educational and fast-paced fun.

If you want to follow our progress, you should keep an eye on the game's webpage at
[https://www.eriksvedang.com/slaget-vid-nissan](https://www.eriksvedang.com/slaget-vid-nissan).

You can also subscribe to Erik Fälth's [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/@eriksminiworlds/), where he will
post videos throughout the project. Here's the first one:
